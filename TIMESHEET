Dec 30/31 - 10 hours on name data exploration, name generator, hierarchy construction
Jan 20 - 3 hours, google sheets credentials and api tests, reading/munging data into pandas dataframes
Jan 24 - 4 hours, step handler for steps `Create Output File` and `Load File Into Memory`, have logic to read data locally if it exists, else pull from online endpoint (using shortcut to read same data from google sheets and update the Active Date.  Will need to adjust this later to talk to workday endpoints.)
Feb 3 - 2 hours, File storage in memory, `Load Field Names` and `MapFields` steps

Feb 4 - 3.5 hours: Explored and eliminated `LoadUniqueValues` step; made `CreateNewField_FromMap` step to handle reading in and updating of job family segments in its own field
                   `CreateNewField_FromExpression` step to handle derivation of Year, Month, Calendar_Year_Month columns
                   `CreateNewField_FromData` step to handle XYZ_Period
                    Active_Start_Period and Active_End_Period columns are ignored because they are not in Mike's output table
                    Updated SourceField -> DestinationField mappings to match Mike's updated list at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o-odmIXZ2u14Rihbi3HKKbgE0OhCmRkBIqU9TE1BfgY/edit#gid=2011288004

        Session 2:
        4.5 hours:
            Updated `CreateNewField_FromData` to handle
            PA_CUSTOM_TENURE_GRP
            PA_CUSTOM_FIN1 and 2 - still need to test because sample data missing column
            PA_CUSTOM_JOB_FAMILY
            PA_CUSTOM_JOB_LEVEL
            PA_CUSTOM_REGION- mapping broken as specified, just copy over Client_Region to new column time
            All PA_CROSSTAB_* columns, need to revisit after testing the FIN columns with better test data

Feb 10
   Session 1: 
      1.5 hr: 
        -- Forked to version 2 for reading modified instruction set, refactored how sheet name and instruction step range are defined (now at the top of file)
        --Started testing with large input files for Active, Start , Exits. Encoding cached files in UTF-8 to avoid encoding errors.

Feb 11:
   Session 1:
      7 hr: 
        --command line arguments to specify instruction sheet and instruction step range
        --refactor `Load File Into Memory` step
        --Refactor `CreateNewField_FromData` steps and test with new sample data

        --Hierarchy calculation

Feb 17:
    3 hour: Output metric design and prototype

Feb 18:
    2.5 hour - refactor CreateMetricOutput function
    2 hour - refactor CreateMetricOutput function, works with Year, and XYZ_Period inputs

Feb 19:
    1 hour - initial test of metric_output_actual function on Actual 'Total' and 'Custom_Tenure_Group' segments
    3.5 hour onward 
      -- hierarchy for starts and exits; match to min (max) date for Starts (Exits) per Client_ID among the Active records
      -- full test of metric_output_actual

Feb 25:
    1 hour - testing and documentation
    
Running Total = 49.5
